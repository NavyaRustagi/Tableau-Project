# Tableau-Project
This is a Tableau project I created to understand credit card complaints better. The dashboard shows the number of complaints, how quickly they were responded to, how many are still in progress, and overall trends over time. It also includes location-wise complaints, top issues people faced, and other useful information. I used different types of charts and visuals to make the data easier to read and understand. As a fresher, this project helped me learn how to work with data, use Tableau, and create a dashboard that gives clear insights in a simple and interactive way.
